File is pretty simple, notebook is divided by each question indicated by the markdown boxes. Almost each code cell outputs an answer to a question, so if the output (print statments) aren't present, simply download the notebook and run it.

There are notes in each code cell explaining the code and method behind the answers and implementations.
